## Introduction

This project is part of the C++ Module 00 and consists of two exercises: "My Awesome PhoneBook" and "The Job Of Your Dreams." In this project, we explore fundamental concepts of C++ programming, including classes, objects, member functions, input/output, and file handling. For details about the exercises see the [subject](en.subject.pdf)

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **C++ Fundamentals**: The exercises in this module cover fundamental concepts in C++ programming, including namespaces, classes, member functions, initialization lists, static, const, and other basic elements of the language.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Exercise 01 introduces OOP principles, emphasizing class design and encapsulation. This foundational concept is crucial for structuring code efficiently and promoting reusability.

- **Command-line Argument Processing**: Exercise 00 demonstrates handling command-line arguments, an essential skill in C++ programming. It involves parsing and processing arguments passed to a program.

- **Text Transformation and Manipulation**: Exercise 00 requires text transformation and manipulation by converting text to uppercase. This showcases fundamental string handling techniques.

- **File Handling and Parsing**: Exercise 02 focuses on file handling and parsing, vital for reading and processing data from external sources, such as log files. It also emphasizes debugging and troubleshooting skills to recover lost code.

- **User Input Validation**: Exercise 01 involves user interaction and input validation, ensuring that the program handles user input correctly and gracefully.

### Why It's Relevant

- **Strong C++ Foundation**: This module serves as a starting point for building a strong foundation in C++ programming. Understanding these fundamental concepts is essential for becoming a proficient C++ developer.

- **Real-world Application**: The exercises reflect real-world scenarios that software developers encounter. Learning how to process command-line arguments, manipulate text, work with files, and validate user input are practical skills applicable to various programming tasks.

- **Problem-Solving and Debugging**: Exercise 02 highlights problem-solving and debugging skills. These are crucial in the professional world, where developers often need to recover lost code or understand existing codebases.

- **Code Structure and Design**: Exercise 01 introduces Object-Oriented Programming principles and class design. Structuring code effectively and encapsulating data are critical aspects of writing maintainable and scalable applications.

- **Versatility**: The skills acquired in this module are transferable to other programming languages and scenarios. They form the building blocks for more advanced C++ development in later modules.



## Exercise 00: Megaphone

**Objective**: Create a program that behaves like a megaphone, converting text to uppercase.

- When the program is executed, it should take text as input and convert it to uppercase.
- If no text is provided as a command-line argument, it should display a loud feedback noise.

**Key Concepts Demonstrated**:
- Command-line arguments processing.
- Text transformation and manipulation.

**Why It's Relevant**:
- Demonstrates handling command-line arguments, a common task in C++ programs.
- Highlights text transformation and processing, a fundamental programming skill.

**Run The Program**

To run the program for Exercise 00, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Navigate to the folder of the exercise using the `cd` command:**

   ```bash
   cd path/to/exercise_folder

Remember to replace `"path/to/exercise_folder"` with the actual path to the folder where your "My Awesome PhoneBook" program is located.

3. **Compile the program**

    ```bash
    make

4. **Run the program with**

    ```bash
    ./megaphone "shhhhh... I think the students are asleep..."
    ```
    
    ```bash
    ./megaphone

## Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook

**Objective**: Create a basic phonebook application with two classes: `PhoneBook` and `Contact`.

- `PhoneBook` class manages a list of contacts, limited to a maximum of 8 entries.
- `Contact` class represents a phonebook entry with fields like first name, last name, nickname, phone number, and darkest secret.

**Key Concepts Demonstrated**:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- Class design and encapsulation.
- Use of arrays to store data.
- Input validation and user interaction.

**Why It's Relevant**:
- Demonstrates understanding of OOP, a fundamental concept in C++ and many other programming languages.
- Shows proficiency in class design and data encapsulation.
- Highlights input validation and user interaction, important skills for any software developer.

**Run The Program**
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Navigate to the folder of the exercise using the `cd` command:**

   ```bash
   cd path/to/exercise_folder

Remember to replace `"path/to/exercise_folder"` with the actual path to the folder where your "My Awesome PhoneBook" program is located.

3. **Compile the program**

    ```bash
    make

4. **Run the program**

    ```bash
    ./phonebook


## Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams

**Objective**: Recreate a lost source file, "Account.cpp," using the provided "Account.hpp" header file and a log file.

- Analyze a log file to understand the expected behavior of the missing "Account" class.
- Reconstruct the "Account.cpp" source file based on the header file and log information.
- Pass tests to ensure the recreated class behaves correctly.

**Key Concepts Demonstrated**:
- File handling and parsing.
- Understanding of header files and implementation files.
- Debugging and troubleshooting code.

**Why It's Relevant**:
- Emphasizes problem-solving and debugging skills, essential for resolving real-world coding issues.
- Demonstrates the ability to work with existing code and documentation to recreate missing components.
- Shows the importance of file handling and code recovery, which can be crucial in a professional development environment.

**Run The Program**
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Navigate to the folder of the exercise using the `cd` command:**

   ```bash
   cd path/to/exercise_folder

Remember to replace `"path/to/exercise_folder"` with the actual path to the folder where your "My Awesome PhoneBook" program is located.

3. **Compile the program**
