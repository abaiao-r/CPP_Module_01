# Project Overview

The C++ Module 01 project provides a comprehensive exploration of vital programming concepts and essential features of the C++ language. It serves as a pivotal milestone in your journey, offering practical experience in memory management, pointers, references, and the effective implementation of switch statements. Through a series of guided exercises, you'll establish a robust foundation in C++, gaining valuable insights into the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).

# Significance and Relevance

This project holds significant relevance for several key reasons:

- **Memory Management:** A profound understanding of memory allocation and deallocation in C++ is imperative for writing efficient and error-free code. You'll learn to discern between stack and heap memory, along with techniques to prevent memory leaks.

- **Pointers and References:** Pointers are powerful tools in C++ for handling memory and data. You'll delve into the intricacies of pointers, including pointers to members, and explore the concept of references as an alternative approach to data manipulation.

- **Switch Statements:** The switch statement is a versatile control structure for effectively managing multiple branching scenarios. You'll master its use for seamless decision-making within your programs.

# Key Concepts in Focus

Throughout this project, you'll engage with and master several pivotal concepts, including:

- **Memory Allocation:** A comprehensive understanding of dynamically allocating memory (heap) and statically allocating memory (stack), along with efficient management of memory resources.

- **Pointer Manipulation:** Proficiency in working with pointers to access and manipulate memory locations and objects.

- **Reference Utilization:** Leveraging references as an alternative to pointers for streamlined data manipulation and memory access.

- **Switch Statement Application:** Harnessing the switch statement for seamless control flow and effective decision-making in code.

The practical exercises and hands-on coding challenges in this project will equip you with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in C++ programming. This foundation will serve as a springboard for your continued learning and development in this powerful language.


## Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ

## Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence

#### Introduction:
This exercise involves creating classes and managing relationships between them. You'll implement a Weapon class and two classes, HumanA and HumanB, which demonstrate different ways of using objects.

#### Relevance:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++.
- Composition and object relationships.
- Constructors and setters.

## Exercise 04: Sed is for losers

#### Introduction:
This exercise involves creating a program that replaces all occurrences of a string in a file in C++.

#### Relevance:
- Regular expressions and pattern matching.
- Text substitution and string manipulation.
- Command-line interface (CLI) usage.


#### Key Concepts:
- File input/output (I/O) in C++.
- String manipulation with `std::string`.
- Command-line arguments.

#### How to Run:
1. Navigate to the `ex04` directory.
2. On the command line, run the following command:
```
 make && ./replace [filename] [string1] [string2]
```
note: [filename] is the name of the file you want to edit, [string1] is the string you want to replace, and [string2] is the string you want to replace it with.

3. To check if the program worked, run the following command:
```
diff [filename] [filename].replace
```
note: [filename] is the name of the file you want to edit.

4. If the program worked, the command line will not return anything. If the program did not work, the command line will return the differences between the two files.

## Exercise 05: Harl 2.0
